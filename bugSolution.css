The solution involves adding spaces around the operators in the `calc()` function. The corrected CSS ensures that the browser correctly interprets and performs the calculation.

For example:

Incorrect:

```css
width:calc(100%-10px);
```

Correct:

```css
width:calc(100% - 10px);
```

By adding the spaces, the browser can correctly calculate the width.
