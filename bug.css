The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, a common mistake is forgetting to leave spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /). Forgetting spaces results in an unexpected behaviour, and the browser won't perform calculations correctly. For example, `width:calc(100%-10px);` will produce an error, instead of working as expected. The correct form should be: `width: calc(100% - 10px);`
